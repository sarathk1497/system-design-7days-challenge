# 💻 **Coding keeps you busy. System design keeps you unstoppable.** ⚡

Welcome to **Day 0** of my **7-day System Design beginner journey**!  
Today, we’re covering the **fundamentals** — what system design is, its **core components**, **requirements**, and the **approach**.

---

## 1️⃣ **What is System Design?**

System design is **planning how a software system works behind the scenes**.  
It ensures the system:  

- **Handles growth** (scalable)  
- **Keeps running even when things fail** (reliable)  
- **Performs well under load** (efficient)  

Think of it as **designing the invisible architecture** that makes your favorite apps work seamlessly.

## 2️⃣ **How Do We Start Designing a System?**

Every design starts by understanding the **requirements**:

- **Functional requirements**: *what the system should do*  
  *(e.g., users can place orders)*  
- **Non-functional requirements**: *how well it should do it*  
  *(e.g., handle millions of users, respond quickly)*  

These requirements form the **foundation for every design decision**.

## 3️⃣ **What Do We Need to Design a System?**

A system isn’t just code. Its **building blocks** include:

- **Clients**: web or mobile users sending requests  
- **API Gateway / Web Servers**: first point of entry for requests  
- **Application Servers**: handle business logic  
- **Database Layer**: stores and retrieves data (**SQL & NoSQL**)  
- **Cache**: speeds up frequent queries (**Redis, Memcached**)  
- **Load Balancers**: distribute traffic across servers  
- **Message Queues / Streaming**: handle async communication (**Kafka, RabbitMQ**)  
- **CDN**: deliver static content fast globally (**Cloudflare, Akamai**)  
- **Monitoring & Logging**: track performance and detect issues  

---

## 4️⃣ **High-Level Design (HLD)**

HLD is the **big picture**:  

- Shows **main components** of the system  
- Shows **how components communicate**  
- Includes **storage and service choices**  

It’s like **drawing the map of the system before building it**.

---

## 5️⃣ **Low-Level Design (LLD)**

LLD dives into the **details**:

- **Class diagrams and methods**  
- **Database schema and relationships**  
- **APIs and service contracts**  

It’s about **how each piece works and connects to others**.

---

## 6️⃣ **How to Approach a System Design Question**

Step-by-step approach:

- **Clarify the problem**  
- **Estimate scale and load**  
- **Design the system (HLD → LLD)**  
- **Refine and consider trade-offs**  
- **Review for scalability, reliability, and performance**  

---

✅ **In short**:

- **Functional requirements** = *what the system does*  
- **Non-functional requirements** = *how well it does it*  
- **HLD** = *big picture architecture*  
- **LLD** = *detailed design*
