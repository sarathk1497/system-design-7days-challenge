💻 Coding keeps you busy. System design keeps you unstoppable. ⚡

Welcome to Day 0 of my 7-day System Design beginner journey! Today, we’re covering the fundamentals — what system design is, its core components, requirements, and the approach.

1. What is System Design?

System design is planning how a software system works behind the scenes.
It’s about making sure the system:

Handles growth (scalable)

Keeps running even when things fail (reliable)

Performs well under load (efficient)

Think of it as designing the invisible architecture that makes your favorite apps work seamlessly.

2. How Do We Start Designing a System?

Every design starts by understanding the requirements:

Functional requirements: what the system should do (e.g., users can place orders)

Non-functional requirements: how well it should do it (e.g., handle millions of users, respond quickly)

These requirements set the foundation for every design decision.

3. What Do We Need to Design a System?

A system isn’t just code. Its building blocks include:

Clients: web or mobile users sending requests

API Gateway / Web Servers: first point of entry for requests

Application Servers: handle business logic

Database Layer: stores and retrieves data (SQL & NoSQL)

Cache: speeds up frequent queries (Redis, Memcached)

Load Balancers: distribute traffic across servers

Message Queues / Streaming: handle async communication (Kafka, RabbitMQ)

CDN: deliver static content fast globally (Cloudflare, Akamai)

Monitoring & Logging: track performance and detect issues

4. High-Level Design (HLD)

HLD is the big picture:

Shows main components of the system

How these components communicate

Storage and service choices
It’s like drawing the map of the system before building it.

5. Low-Level Design (LLD)

LLD dives into the details:

Class diagrams and methods

Database schema and relationships

APIs and service contracts
It’s about how each piece works and connects to others.

6. How to Approach a System Design Question

A step-by-step method makes it simple:

Clarify the problem

Estimate scale and load

Design the system (HLD → LLD)

Refine and consider trade-offs

Review for scalability, reliability, and performance

✅ In short:

Functional requirements = what the system does

Non-functional requirements = how well it does it

HLD = big picture architecture

LLD = detailed design
